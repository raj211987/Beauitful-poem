come with no wrapping or pretty pink bows. 
I am who I am, from my head to my toes. 
I tend to get loud when speaking my mind. 
Even a little crazy some of the time.

In all chaotic beauty lies a wounded work of art. 
Beautiful but torn, wreaking havoc on my heart.
Camouflaged by insecurities, blinded by it all.
I love the way you sit there and barely notice me at all.
